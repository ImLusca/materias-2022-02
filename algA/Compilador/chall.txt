Question:

Design the software aspect of the micro-architecture for the following instruction set specifications.

Registers: R0, R1, R2 (each 8 bits)
Memory address space: 64k bytes.
Instructions:
(a) Copy value from ra to rb
MOV ra, rb

(b) Copy value from r to mem.
MOV r, mem

(c) Copy value from mem to r.
MOV mem, r

(d) Place value of ra + rb into ra
ADD ra, rb

(e) Place value of ra - rb into ra
SUB ra, rb

(f) Place value of ra OR rb, ra AND rb, ra XOR rb (respectively) into ra
OR ra, rb
AND ra, rb
XOR ra, rb

(g) Jump to address location mem
JMP mem

(h) Jump by a relative position (-128 to 127) if ra is greater or equal to rb.
BGE ra, rb, rel

(i) Jump by a relative position (-128 to 127) if ra is equal to rb.
BEQ ra, rb, rel

(j) Halt the execution.
HLT

After that, write a simple simulator that takes as input an initial state of the memory, and starts executing code at address 0x0000.
